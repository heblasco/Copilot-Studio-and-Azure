# Export and Import a Solution via Copilot Studio

## Overview
This guide walks you through:
- Exporting a solution from one environment using **Copilot Studio**.
- Adding the previously created agent **“Power Platform Licensing”** to the solution.
- Importing the solution into a new environment.

---

## Prerequisites
Before starting:
- Ensure you have **System Administrator** or **Environment Maker** role in both environments.
- Access to **Copilot Studio**.
- The agent **“Power Platform Licensing”** is available in your developer environment.

## Step 1: Navigate to Copilot Studio
1. Go to https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com.
2. In the **Environment selector** (top-right corner), choose the environment where the solution currently resides.

## Step 2: Locate the Solution
1. In the left navigation pane, click "..." and select **Solutions**.
2. Create a new solution for you to add the agent and it's components.
3. Name the solution "Power Platform Licensing Agent Solution".
4. Select an existing publisher or create one (if needed).
5. Create solution.

## Step 3: Add the Agent to the Solution
1. Open the solution by clicking its name.
2. Click **Add existing** → **Copilot Agent**.
3. Search for **“Power Platform Licensing”**.
4. Select the agent and click **Add**.
5. Confirm the agent is now listed in the solution components.
6. Remember that if you have dependent components for your agent (e.g environment variables, connection references, etc) you should also add them to the solution.
