The quadratic formula is a powerful tool for solving any quadratic equation. Let me walk you through it step by step.\n\n**The Quadratic Formula:**\nFor any equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, the solutions are:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n1. Identify coefficients a, b, and c\n2. Calculate the discriminant (b² - 4ac)\n3. Substitute values into the formula\n4. Solve for both + and - cases\n\n**Example:**\nSolve: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0\n- a = 2, b = 5, c = -3\n- Discriminant = 5² - 4(2)(-3) = 25 + 24 = 49\n- x = (-5 ± √49) / (2×2) = (-5 ± 7) / 4\n- Solutions: x = 1/2 or x = -3\n\nWould you like to try solving one together?"}]}
